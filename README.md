# the_recipe_bar

## Description

This project is a Cocktail Recipe Application and itâ€™s a tool that helps the user search for cocktail recipes by name or ingredient while providing jokes for entertainment. The application provides a list of matching recipes, including instructions and an image of the drink. It also provides details about the searched ingredient and a search history feature that allows users to view a list of saved cocktails and ingredients from previous searches.

Our motivation is to create a functional webpage, to showcase our skills to employers. The motivation behind the project is to provide the users with a tool that makes it easy and quick to find and serve cocktails and provide jokes for humor. The application solves the problem of spending too much time searching for cocktail recipes by the name or ingredient, allowing users to serve their customers faster and more efficiently for an overall customer experience.

Through building this project, us developers can learn how to create a web application that is responsive and have a polished user interface using Bulma a CSS framework. It also allows users to search for data, display information, and store user data. We can also learn how to use APIs to retrieve data and integrate it into the application.
